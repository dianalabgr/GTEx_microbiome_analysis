In this folder: there are the scripts for replicating the results shown in the paper. For replicating the results, there is no need to recreate the taxonomic and functional profiles as they are already provided in Zenodo along with the needed GTEx samples metadata file.

1. number_reads_per_step (needed file from zenodo NumberReads_samples_logs.zip)
2. alphaDiversity_and_core_microbiome
3. ML_models_1vs27Tissues
4. InSilicoContamination
5. ML_model_1vs7tissues_featureImportanceAnalysis
6. BoxPlots_per_microbiome_8ImportantTissues
7. ML_models_with_Kaiju
8. ML_model_1vs7tissues_testLivingTissues
9. Living_dataset
10. ML_models_1vs7Tissues_GeneraLevel
11. ML_models_1vs27Tissues_GeneraLevel
12. ML_models_1vs7Tissues_Genes
13. factor_associated_with_microbiome (Only for this analysis the restricted metadata file from GTEx is needed, as it is necessary to know the medical history and phenotypic trait of each subject)
